    <p class="">A school store is a retail establishment that is owned and operated by a school, and typically located on the school's campus. It is usually run by students, with the help of a faculty adviser. The store sells a variety of items, including school supplies, clothing, snacks, and other merchandise. The purpose of a school store is to provide students, teachers, and staff with the items they need, while also raising money for the school. The store may also serve as a learning opportunity for students, who can gain valuable experience in retail and customer service.</p>
